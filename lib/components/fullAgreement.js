Your bindings must be currently indemnified by their manufacturer and set up correctly by a certified technician to achieve the correct forward pressure. In addition, they must be tested by a certified technician to ensure they release within the manufacturer's specifications.


If the bindings are professionally adjusted and tested, the DIN setting determines the safest release tension setting for your bindings, provided the skier details are accurate.
